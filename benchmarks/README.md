# VL Benchmarking Suite

This directory contains tools to measure and verify the token efficiency of Vibe Language compared to Python.

## Prerequisites

To run the benchmarks effectively and get accurate token counts (matching GPT-4/Claude), you need the `tiktoken` library.

```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

## Running Benchmarks

Run the benchmark script from the root of the repository:

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_suite.py
```

## Methodology

The benchmark compares:
1. **VL Tokens:** The number of tokens required to represent the logic in Vibe Language.
2. **Python Tokens:** The number of tokens required to represent the *same* logic in Python (generated by the VL compiler).

**Savings Calculation:**
`Token Reduction = 1 - (VL_Tokens / Python_Tokens)`

High token reduction percentages directly translate to lower API costs and faster generation times when using LLMs.
