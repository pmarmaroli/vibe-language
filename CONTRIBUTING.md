# Contributing to VL (Vibe Language)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VL! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to build this language together.

## 🎯 Project Vision

VL is a universal programming language optimized for AI-assisted development. Our goal is to create a token-efficient, unambiguous language that makes collaboration between humans and AI seamless.

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)**

We are currently in the early development phase. The language specification is complete, and we're building the core interpreter and compiler.

## 📋 How to Contribute

### Areas Where We Need Help

1. **Core Development**
   - VL Interpreter implementation (Python)
   - VL Compiler (VL → Python/JavaScript)
   - Standard library functions
   - FFI (Foreign Function Interface) implementation

2. **Documentation**
   - Code examples across all domains
   - Tutorial content
   - API documentation
   - Translation to other languages

3. **Tooling**
   - VS Code extension
   - Syntax highlighting for other editors
   - Online playground
   - Testing framework

4. **Community**
   - Blog posts and articles
   - Video tutorials
   - Social media content
   - Conference talks

### Getting Started

1. **Read the Specification**
   - Review the [README.md](README.md) to understand VL's syntax and design
   - Familiarize yourself with the core domains (API, UI, Data, File I/O)

2. **Check Existing Issues**
   - Look at [open issues](../../issues) to find something to work on
   - Issues labeled `good first issue` are great for newcomers
   - Issues labeled `help wanted` are priorities

3. **Join the Discussion**
   - Open an issue to discuss your idea before starting work
   - Ask questions if anything is unclear
   - Share your thoughts on language design

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (for interpreter development)
- Node.js 18+ (for tooling)
- Git

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pmarmaroli/vibe-language.git
cd vibe-language

# Create a virtual environment (Python)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install tiktoken

# Run test suites
python test_examples.py      # Test all example programs
python test_robustness.py    # Test complex scenarios (100% pass rate)
python run_benchmarks.py  # Comprehensive benchmarks
```

## 📝 Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vibe-language.git
cd vibe-language
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pmarmaroli/vibe-language.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Follow the coding style (see below)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run linter
flake8

# Check formatting
black --check .
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add XYZ feature"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with ABC"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Explain what changed and why
- Include screenshots/examples if applicable

## 💻 Coding Standards

### Python (Interpreter/Compiler)

- **Style Guide:** PEP 8
- **Formatter:** Black (line length 100)
- **Linter:** Flake8
- **Type Hints:** Use type hints for all functions
- **Docstrings:** Google style docstrings

**Example:**
```python
def parse_function(vl_code: str) -> FunctionNode:
    """Parse VL function syntax into AST node.
    
    Args:
        vl_code: VL source code string
        
    Returns:
        FunctionNode representing the parsed function
        
    Raises:
        ParseError: If syntax is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Tooling)

- **Style Guide:** Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- **Formatter:** Prettier
- **Linter:** ESLint
- **Types:** TypeScript preferred for new code

### VL Code Examples

- Follow the [language specification](README.md)
- Include comments explaining the code
- Keep examples focused and concise
- Test that examples work

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

**Test structure:**
```python
def test_function_parsing():
    """Test basic function parsing."""
    vl_code = "fn:sum|i:int,int|o:int|ret:op:+(i0,i1)"
    result = parse_function(vl_code)
    assert result.name == "sum"
    assert len(result.inputs) == 2
```

## 📚 Documentation Guidelines

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples
- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

**Documentation types:**
1. **Code comments** - Explain complex logic
2. **Docstrings** - Document functions/classes
3. **README sections** - High-level explanations
4. **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides
5. **Reference docs** - Complete API documentation

## 🤝 Code Review Process

All contributions go through code review:

1. **Automated Checks**
   - Tests must pass
   - Linting must pass
   - Code coverage should not decrease

2. **Human Review**
   - At least one maintainer approval required
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Be open to feedback and suggestions

3. **Merge**
   - Squash commits if requested
   - Maintainer will merge when approved
