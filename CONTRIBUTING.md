## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/pmarmaroli/vibe-language.git
cd vibe-language
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"  # Unix/Mac
$env:PYTHONPATH="$PWD\src"    # Windows

# Verify installation
./vl examples/basic/hello.vl

# Run tests
python tests/codegen/test_codegen_all.py
python tests/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

```bash
# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make changes and test
python tests/codegen/test_codegen_all.py

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add support for X"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

## What We Need

**Note:** We're currently focusing contributions on the **core VL compiler**. The VS Code extension is in private alpha and will be open-sourced before public release.

### High Priority

| Area | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Converters** | JavaScript ↔ VL, TypeScript ↔ VL bidirectional conversion |
| **Compiler** | JS/TS code generator improvements, optimization passes |
| **Language Features** | New VL syntax patterns, domain-specific constructs |
| **Documentation** | Tutorials, examples, video guides |
| **Testing** | Edge cases, real-world code examples, benchmarks |

### Good First Issues

- Add new VL code examples
- Improve error messages
- Write documentation
- Add test cases
- Fix typos and formatting

**Check [Issues](https://github.com/pmarmaroli/vibe-language/issues) labeled `good first issue`**

## Development Guidelines

### Testing

**Before submitting PR:**

```bash
# Run all tests (must pass 100%)
python tests/codegen/test_codegen_all.py
python tests/integration/test_realworld_py2vl.py
python tests/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py
```

**Adding new features:**
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Ensure 100% test pass rate
- Add integration tests for complex features

### Code Style

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings to public functions
- Keep functions focused and small

**Example:**
```python
def compile_to_python(ast: ASTNode) -> str:
    """Compile VL AST to Python source code.
    
    Args:
        ast: The VL abstract syntax tree
        
    Returns:
        Generated Python source code
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

**File Organization:**
- `src/vl/` - Core compiler code
- `tests/` - All test files
- `examples/` - VL code examples
- `docs/` - Documentation

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
feat: add JavaScript converter
fix: resolve Python syntax validation bug
docs: update installation instructions
test: add edge cases for data pipelines
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`
